# My i3 / sway configuration

Using: 
* i3-wm (or i3 compatible wm like sway)
* [dunst](https://dunst-project.org/) - lightweight notification daemon
* [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) - terminal emulator
* [i3status-rust](https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust) - Very resourcefriendly and feature-rich replacement for i3status, written in pure Rust  
* [i3lock-color](https://github.com/PandorasFox/i3lock-color) - i3lock improved, improved again
* feh - wallpaper
* light - backlight control
